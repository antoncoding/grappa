# Introduction

Grappa is a grape-based pomace brandy originally made to prevent waste by using leftovers.

We believe there're lots of waste in capital when it comes to DeFi options. Grappa is here to change that.

## Getting Started

```shell
forge build
forge test
```

### Testing locally

You might find the compile time of `forge build` and `forge test` being long because of the `via-ir` optimization. For the purpose of developing and writing unit tests, try using the `lite` profile:

```shell
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=lite forge test
```

For auto linting and running gas snapshot, you will also need to setup npm environment.

```shell
npm i
```

## Linting

Pre-configured `solhint` and `prettier-plugin-solidity`. Can be run by

```
npm run lint
```

## Run Slither

installation

```shell
pip3 install slither-analyzer
pip3 install solc-select
solc-select install 0.8.13
solc-select use 0.8.13
```

Run analysis

```shell
slither ./src/core/SimpleMargin
slither ./src/core/
```

## Contract Architecture

![](https://i.imgur.com/7LTxemy.png)

This is the basic diagram of how contracts interact with each other in the draft version. A more detail diagram will be added later.

You can see the 3 contracts that compose Grappa are `Oracle`, `MarginAccount` and `OptionToken`.

### `Oracle`

contract to report spot price and expiry price of an asset.

### `MarginAccount`

Depends on if it lives on mainnet or L2s, `MarginAccount` will have different interface and internal account structure, but they stand the same purpose for sellers to depositing collateral and create the option token.

### `OptionToken`

ERC1155 token that represent the right to claim for a non-negative payout at expiry. It can represent a long call position, a long put position, or debit spreads.
